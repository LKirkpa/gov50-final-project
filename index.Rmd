## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the relationship of race and what people choose to declare as a concentration at Harvard (or general majors across the country). As someone that has yet to declare, I feel as though that one's sense of "truly belonging" in a concentration (in regard to race) has influenced why people choose to study a particular field.
